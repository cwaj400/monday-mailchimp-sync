A robust integration service that synchronizes contacts between Monday.com and Mailchimp, with Discord notifications for important events.

## üåü Features

- **Bidirectional Sync**: Keep Monday.com and Mailchimp contacts in sync
- **Webhook Support**: Process Mailchimp events (subscribe, unsubscribe, profile updates)
- **Discord Notifications**: Real-time alerts for important events and errors
- **Environment Management**: Support for development, testing, and production environments
- **Security**: Snyk integration for vulnerability scanning

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- Monday.com account with API access
- Mailchimp account with API access
- Discord webhook URL (for notifications)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monday-mailchimp-sync.git
   cd monday-mailchimp-sync
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your API keys and configuration.

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create environment-specific files for different environments:
- `.env.development` - Development environment
- `.env.test` - Testing environment
- `.env.production` - Production environment

Required variables:
```
# System
NODE_ENV=development

# Monday.com
MONDAY_API_KEY=your_monday_api_key
MONDAY_BOARD_ID=your_monday_board_id
MONDAY_SIGNING_SECRET=your_monday_signing_secret
MONDAY_CLIENT_ID=your_monday_client_id

# Mailchimp
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=your_mailchimp_api_key
MAILCHIMP_SERVER_PREFIX=us1
MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID=your_audience_id
MAILCHIMP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```
## üîí Security

This project uses Snyk for security scanning. Snyk runs automatically before each commit via Husky.

To run a security scan manually:
```bash
npx snyk test
```

To bypass Snyk check during commits (use sparingly):
```bash
SKIP_SNYK=true git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## üìä Error Tracking

This project uses Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring. Errors are automatically captured and reported to Sentry.

To set up Sentry:
1. Create a Sentry account at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
2. Create a new project for Node.js
3. Add your Sentry DSN to the environment variables:
```
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/1234567
```

## üö¢ Deployment

### Vercel

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel. The `vercel.json` file contains the necessary configuration.

To deploy to Vercel:
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
2. Login to Vercel: `vercel login`
3. Deploy: `vercel`

Make sure to set all environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
